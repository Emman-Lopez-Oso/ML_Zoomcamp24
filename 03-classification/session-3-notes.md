# Session 3.1 - Churn Prediction Project
[Good ole Petey's notes](https://knowmledge.com/2023/09/25/ml-zoomcamp-2023-machine-learning-for-classification-part-1/)

Churn is the coming and going of clients. 

Project is essentially trying to predict the likelihood of someone churning out of our company to go to the competitor's.
