# Download and install Anaconda
This is the newest version of anaconda (as of 10/03/2024)
The following lines of code take a little while to run 
`wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.06-1-Linux-x86_64.sh`
`bash Anaconda3-2024.06-1-Linux-x86_64.sh`

- Say `yes` to init
- After it has all initialized, type `cat ~/.bashrc`

- Open a new terminal (type `bash`)

- Enter `which python` in the terminal to confirm that it is using the python coming out of the anaconda dist.
- enter `python -V` to determine version of python we're using (should be 3.12.4) 

Check and see which versions of pandas and other libraries/packages that we have and need to use. 
Use `conda list`
